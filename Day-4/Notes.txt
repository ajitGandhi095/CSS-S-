                  Float & Position
            ====================================
            
=> Folat is used to keep an element floating right/left of UI.It will remove the element from the actual flow, so that the next element will fill the agp when the current element stays left/right.

=>float:left/right
---> NOTE :- If the next element don't want floating element to be it's left/right, it can use "clear" like
     
clear:left/right/both

* Position :-
---------------
=> Position property is used to keep the element to a certain Position in the UI.
Usually there are 5 types of Position:- 
                                        1)static
                                        2)absolute
                                        3)fixed
                                        4)relative
                                        5)stickey
=> By defualt all elements are static. offsets like top,bottom,left,right not have any impact on static.

1)relative:-
----------------
=>It moves relative to it's parent. for example an element with position-relative and left-100px will move 100px left side from it's previous position in parent.

2)absolute:-
-------------
=>In absolute element consider window as parent and if left 100px given, it moves 100px from window not parent.

3)fixed:-
-----------
=> fixed also consider window as parent same as absolute but won't get affected by scrolling.

4)sticky:-
---------------
=> sticky is nothing but relative + fixed.

Z-index:-
-------------
=> It is used when multiple element collide in same space, the one with more z-index will appear over the ones with less z-index.

=> position: absolute; -> Actual root div
=> position: relative; -> Actual parent div
=> position: fixed; -> Not scrolling
=> stickey --> relative + fixed
